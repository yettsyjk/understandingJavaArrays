# Understanding Java Arrays
- Reviewing Fundamentals
Lightning talk regarding Java single arrays and multi-dimensional arrays
- Attending software developer course SD26 at Skill Distillery April 2020, lightning talk regarding Java single arrays and multi-dimensional arrays.

## Lesson Learned
- Course was supposed to be held on-site. However, due to CoVid19 we were all shifted to learn online via zoom. That dynamic alongside being introduced to Java 8 as a programming language makes understanding concepts a difficult. If there are any errors within my presentation deck I look forward to feedback from my peers upon presentation.
