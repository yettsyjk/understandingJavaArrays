# Understanding Java Arrays
## Reviewing Fundamentals
- Lightning talk regarding Java single arrays and multi-dimensional arrays
- Attending software developer course SD26 at Skill Distillery April 2020, lightning talk regarding Java single arrays and multi-dimensional arrays.

## Lesson Learned
- Course was supposed to be held on-site. However, due to CoVid19 we were all shifted to learn online via zoom. The before mentioned dynamic alongside being introduced to Java 8 as a programming language makes understanding certain concepts difficult. For me: Arrays.
- If there are any errors within my presentation deck I look forward to feedback from my peers and instructors upon presentation.
